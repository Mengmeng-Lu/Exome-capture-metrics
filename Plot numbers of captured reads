#### Count the nubmers of captured reads on target/near-target/off-target regions using the *.mapped.bam file of each sample.

bedtools intersect -abam <*.mapped.bam> -b <target_regions_coord.bed>  -f 0.75 > <*.overlap.bam>

samtools  flagstat <*.overlap.bam> > <*.overlap.bam.stats>

###### Generate a <numbers_of_captured_reads.txt> file including four columns as: 
######  sample_ID numbers_Reads_on_target numbers_Reads_on_near-target  numbers_Reads_on_off-target


#### Step two: Barplot to show the number of captured reads of each sample on target/near-target/off-target regions.
